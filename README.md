# Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks. It demonstrates the complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation and visualization.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Augmentation**:
  Efficient preprocessing of datasets using TensorFlow/Keras utilities.
- **Custom CNN Architecture**:
  Flexible and modular CNN design tailored for image classification.
- **Model Training**:
  Robust training with validation monitoring and callbacks.
- **Evaluation and Visualization**:
  Performance metrics and visualizations to assess model effectiveness.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib, NumPy, and other standard libraries

## Dataset
Replace the dataset loading code to use your custom dataset or a standard one like CIFAR-10 or MNIST.

## Acknowledgments
This notebook was created to showcase CNN implementation for educational purposes and can be adapted for real-world tasks.
