The Jupyter Notebook is a Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for a classification task. It includes data preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation, and visualization steps. Here's an overview of its content:

# Key Components in the Notebook:

# Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Utilizes TensorFlow/Keras for loading and augmenting data.
Likely targets a common dataset like CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom image set.

# Model Definition:
Defines a CNN architecture using layers such as convolutional, pooling, dropout, and dense layers.
The model is compiled with a loss function, optimizer, and metrics.

# Training the Model:
Splits data into training and validation sets.
Trains the model using model.fit() with callbacks for efficiency.

# Evaluation:
Evaluates the model performance on test data.
Displays metrics like accuracy and loss.

# Visualization:
Plots training and validation accuracy/loss curves.


Provides a confusion matrix or sample predictions to assess the model.
